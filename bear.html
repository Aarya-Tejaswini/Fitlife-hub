            <h2>How to Defend Yourself Against Bears</h2>
            <p>If you encounter a bear, these steps may help you stay safe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay calm and try to make yourself appear larger by raising your arms or opening your jacket.</li>
                <li>Speak in a calm but assertive voice to let the bear know you're human.</li>
                <li>Back away slowly, but do not run. Running may trigger a chase response from the bear.</li>
                <li>If the bear charges, use bear spray (if available) to deter the bear from attacking you.</li>
                <li>If no bear spray is available, try to climb a tree or get behind a large object to put distance between you and the bear.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Do if Attacked</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Defend yourself by targeting the bearâ€™s eyes or nose, if possible.</li>
                <li>Play dead only if the bear is a grizzly bear, as they may stop attacking once they believe you are no longer a threat.</li>
                <li>If it's a black bear, fight back aggressively to try to scare it away.</li>
            </ul>
