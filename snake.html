            <h2>How to Defend Yourself Against Snakes</h2>
            <p>In case you encounter a snake, here are some steps to follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay calm and keep still to avoid provoking the snake.</li>
                <li>If you spot the snake, do not approach it, and move away slowly.</li>
                <li>Do not try to handle or kill the snake; instead, give it space to slither away.</li>
                <li>If youâ€™re hiking, wear thick boots and pants to reduce the chances of a bite.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Do if Bitten</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Call for medical help immediately. Time is critical in snake bite situations.</li>
                <li>Try to remain as still as possible to slow the spread of venom through your body.</li>
                <li>Do not attempt to suck out the venom or apply a tourniquet, as these are ineffective and dangerous.</li>
            </ul>
