            <h2>Mammogram Guidelines and Importance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When to Start:</strong> Women should begin regular mammograms at age 40. If you have a family history of breast cancer, you may need to start earlier.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Mammograms should be done every year or as advised by your healthcare provider.</li>
                <li><strong>What to Expect:</strong> A mammogram involves an X-ray of the breasts. It's important to inform the technician if you're pregnant or might be pregnant.</li>
                <li><strong>Why It's Important:</strong> Mammograms are crucial for detecting breast cancer early, which can lead to better outcomes and more treatment options.</li>
                <li><strong>After the Mammogram:</strong> Results will be sent to your doctor. If there are concerns, your doctor may recommend additional tests, such as an ultrasound or biopsy.</li>
