            <h2>How to Defend Yourself Against an Aggressive Dog</h2>
            <p>If you are ever confronted by an aggressive dog, here are some practical steps to stay safe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay calm and avoid making sudden movements.</li>
                <li>Do not make eye contact with the dog, as it may interpret that as a threat.</li>
                <li>Try to back away slowly and steadily without turning your back on the dog.</li>
                <li>If the dog attacks, protect your face, chest, and throat, and try to use an object to shield yourself, like a backpack or jacket.</li>
                <li>If available, use pepper spray or any other deterrents to stop the dog.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Do if Bitten</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay calm and try to get away from the dog as quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>Seek medical attention immediately to prevent infection and ensure proper care for the bite.</li>
            </ul>
